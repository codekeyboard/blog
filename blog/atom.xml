        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever struggled with a tough math problem, you know how useful it is to think a little longer and work through it carefully. OpenAI’s o1 model showed that when LLMs are trained to do the same—by using more compute during inference—they get significantly better at solving reasoning tasks like mathematics, coding, and logic.</p>
<p>However, the recipe behind OpenAI’s reasoning models has been a well-kept secret. That is, until last week, when DeepSeek released their DeepSeek-R1 model and promptly broke the internet (and the stock market!).</p>
<p>Besides performing as well or better than o1, the DeepSeek-R1 release was accompanied by a detailed tech report that outlined the key steps of their training recipe. This recipe involved several innovations, most notably the application of pure reinforcement learning to teach a base language model how to reason without any human supervision. As shown in the figure below, making a powerful reasoning model is now very simple if you have access to a capable base model and a high-quality data mixture:</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deepseek-r1-training-pipeline">DeepSeek-R1 Training Pipeline<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/what-is-deepseek-r1#deepseek-r1-training-pipeline" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DeepSeek-R1 Training Pipeline" title="Direct link to DeepSeek-R1 Training Pipeline">​</a></h2>
<p>However, the DeepSeek-R1 release leaves open several questions about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data collection</strong>: How were the reasoning-specific datasets curated?</li>
<li><strong>Model training</strong>: No training code was released by DeepSeek, so it is unknown which hyperparameters work best and how they differ across different model families and scales.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling laws</strong>: What are the compute and data trade-offs in training reasoning models?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions prompted us to launch the <strong>Open-R1</strong> project, an initiative to systematically reconstruct DeepSeek-R1’s data and training pipeline, validate its claims, and push the boundaries of open reasoning models. By building Open-R1, we aim to provide transparency on how reinforcement learning can enhance reasoning, share reproducible insights with the open-source community, and create a foundation for future models to leverage these techniques.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-they-do-it">How Did They Do It?<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/what-is-deepseek-r1#how-did-they-do-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Did They Do It?" title="Direct link to How Did They Do It?">​</a></h2>
<p>DeepSeek-R1 is a reasoning model built on the foundation of <strong>DeepSeek-V3</strong>. Like any good reasoning model, it starts with a strong base model, and DeepSeek-V3 is exactly that. This <strong>671B Mixture of Experts (MoE)</strong> model performs on par with heavyweights like <strong>Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o</strong>. What’s especially impressive is how cost-efficient it was to train—just <strong>$5.5M</strong>—thanks to architectural changes like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi Token Prediction (MTP)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)</strong></li>
<li><strong>A LOT of hardware optimization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>DeepSeek also introduced two models: <strong>DeepSeek-R1-Zero</strong> and <strong>DeepSeek-R1</strong>, each with a distinct training approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DeepSeek-R1-Zero</strong> skipped supervised fine-tuning altogether and relied entirely on reinforcement learning (RL), using <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong> to make the process more efficient. A simple reward system guided the model, providing feedback based on the accuracy and structure of its answers. This approach helped the model develop useful reasoning skills, such as breaking problems into steps and verifying its own outputs. However, its responses often lacked clarity and were difficult to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DeepSeek-R1</strong> improved upon this by starting with a <strong>"cold start" phase</strong>, fine-tuning on a small set of carefully crafted examples to enhance clarity and readability. From there, it underwent additional RL and refinement steps, including <strong>rejecting low-quality outputs using human preference-based and verifiable rewards</strong>. This resulted in a model that not only reasons well but also produces polished and consistent answers.</p>

<p>The release of DeepSeek-R1 is an amazing boon for the community, but they didn’t release everything—although the model weights are open, the <strong>datasets and training code</strong> are not 😢.</p>
<p>The goal of <strong>Open-R1</strong> is to build these last missing pieces so that the whole research and industry community can build similar or better models using these recipes and datasets. And by doing this in the open, <strong>everybody in the community can contribute!</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, here’s our plan of attack:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replicate the R1-Distill models</strong> by distilling a high-quality reasoning dataset from DeepSeek-R1.</li>
<li><strong>Replicate the pure RL pipeline</strong> that DeepSeek used to create R1-Zero. This will involve curating new, large-scale datasets for math, reasoning, and code.</li>
<li><strong>Show we can go from base model → SFT → RL</strong> via multi-stage training.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Open-R1 Plan" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/image-2-75167e81225a0fa432aa6e48f85a10ef.png" width="944" height="1060" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The synthetic datasets will allow everyone to fine-tune existing or new LLMs into reasoning models by simply fine-tuning on them. The training recipes involving RL will serve as a starting point for anyone to build similar models from scratch and will allow researchers to build even more advanced methods on top.</p>
<p>We <strong>don’t want to stop at math datasets</strong>. There’s a lot of potential in exploring other areas, obvious ones like <strong>code</strong>, but also <strong>scientific fields such as medicine</strong>, where reasoning models could have a significant impact.</p>
<p>This initiative isn’t just about replicating results—it’s about <strong>sharing insights with the community</strong>. By documenting what works, what doesn’t, and why, we hope to save others from wasting time and compute on unproductive paths.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting, we’d love your help! Whether it’s contributing code, joining discussions on Hugging Face, or sharing feedback, there are plenty of ways to get involved.</p>
<p>Let’s build this together! 🚀</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you, like me, ventured into the world of data science (be it through college or one of the countless online courses), you may have harbored the dream of creating an ML/AI software product that people can use. A product just like those our CS friends seem to code up effortlessly.</p>
<p>But if you ever tried your hand at full-stack web development, you’d soon face the seemingly insurmountable hurdles of configuration, deployment, terminal commands and servers and so on.</p>
<p><em>Just one of the many frustrated convos with my college roommate during the initial stages coding my app.</em></p>
<p>I know this all too well, having spent countless hours floundering helplessly, which only deepened my inferiority complex that I’d never manage to craft a functioning software app.</p>
<p>But exactly one year ago, on the 21st of January, a weekend unexpectedly made free by passport troubles and a cancelled trip, I embarked on a journey to make an AI app. It was a journey that led me to unexpected places — teaming up with a co-founder halfway across the world, joining a San Francisco startup accelerator, and eventually growing to thousands of users with significant annual revenue (check out my app, Podsmart! We summarize podcasts).</p>
<p>But most importantly, it was a journey full of frustrations, backtracking, mistakes, and rework. It was about navigating the bewildering world of software development without a formal CS/SWE background.</p>
<p>So, looking back at the past year building my first software product, I’ve compiled a guide of some technical tips — this is for any data science enthusiast who wants to build a functional web app serving thousands of users.</p>
<p>This guide is born from my struggles and learnings over a year, and represents advice I would have loved to tell my one-year-younger self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These tips are from my specific personal experiences, and may work differently for others. I also do not have any relationship or affiliation with any of the tools recommended here.</p>

<p>To build a functional web app, you need both a <strong>web interface (frontend)</strong> for users to interact with, and a <strong>server (backend)</strong> to handle data processing, storage, and interacting with ML/AI models.</p>
<p>You may have heard of tools like <strong>Streamlit</strong> for quick demos, but for a production-ready app, you’ll need more customization.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dangers-of-youtube-web-development-tutorials">The dangers of YouTube web development tutorials<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/from-data-scientist-to-ai-developer#the-dangers-of-youtube-web-development-tutorials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The dangers of YouTube web development tutorials" title="Direct link to The dangers of YouTube web development tutorials">​</a></h2>
<p>As a data scientist, I initially relied heavily on <strong>YouTube tutorials</strong> for full-stack app development. However, I ran into several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdated tutorials</strong>: Many tutorials were outdated, particularly when versions of frameworks like React change.</li>
<li><strong>Beginner-friendly</strong>: Many tutorials are focused on making simple, beginner-friendly demos, which lack scalability for production apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these frustrations, I learned valuable lessons through trial and error, and I hope you can avoid these mistakes.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tip-1-use-nextjs-instead-of-react">Tip #1: Use Next.js instead of React<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/from-data-scientist-to-ai-developer#tip-1-use-nextjs-instead-of-react" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tip #1: Use Next.js instead of React" title="Direct link to Tip #1: Use Next.js instead of React">​</a></h2>
<p>I initially followed many YouTube tutorials that used <strong>React</strong>, but faced limitations with SEO and server-side rendering. Switching to <strong>Next.js</strong> improved performance drastically and made it much easier to implement features like SEO and server-side rendering.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you’re running a customer support center, and your AI chatbot not only answers queries but does so by pulling the most up-to-date information from a live database. This isn’t science fiction—it’s the magic of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)!</p>
<p>It is an innovative approach that bridges the gap between static knowledge and evolving information, enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLM) with real-time access to external knowledge sources. This significantly reduces the chances of AI hallucinations and increases the reliability of generated content.</p>
<p>By integrating a powerful retrieval mechanism, RAG empowers AI systems to deliver informed, trustworthy, and up-to-date outputs, making it a game-changer for applications ranging from customer support to complex problem-solving in specialized domains.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation">What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?" title="Direct link to What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?">​</a></h2>
<p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique in the field of generative AI that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by integrating a retrieval mechanism to access external knowledge sources in real-time.</p>
<p>Instead of relying solely on static, pre-loaded training data, RAG dynamically fetches the most current and relevant information to generate precise, contextually accurate responses. Hence, integrating RAG’s retrieval-based and generation-based approaches provides a robust database for LLMs.</p>
<p>Using RAG as one of the NLP techniques helps to ensure that the responses are grounded in factual information, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or misleading answers (hallucinations). Additionally, it provides the ability to access the latest information without the need for frequent retraining of the model.</p>
<p>Hence, retrieval augmented generation has redefined the standard for information search and navigation with LLMs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-rag-work">How Does RAG Work?<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#how-does-rag-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Does RAG Work?" title="Direct link to How Does RAG Work?">​</a></h2>
<p>A RAG model operates in two main phases: the retrieval phase and the generation phase. These phases work together to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-retrieval-phase">1. Retrieval Phase<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#1-retrieval-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Retrieval Phase" title="Direct link to 1. Retrieval Phase">​</a></h3>
<p>The retrieval phase fetches relevant information from an external knowledge base. This phase is crucial because it provides contextually relevant data to the LLM. Algorithms search for and retrieve snippets of information that are relevant to the user’s query.</p>
<p>These snippets come from various sources like databases, document repositories, and the internet. The retrieved information is then combined with the user’s prompt and passed on to the LLM for further processing.</p>
<p>This leads to the creation of high-performing LLM applications that have access to the latest and most reliable information, minimizing the chances of generating incorrect or misleading responses.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-components-of-the-retrieval-phase">Key Components of the Retrieval Phase:<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#key-components-of-the-retrieval-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Components of the Retrieval Phase:" title="Direct link to Key Components of the Retrieval Phase:">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use of Embedding Models:</strong> Embedding models convert user queries and documents into numerical representations (vectors), allowing for efficient searching in a vector database.</li>
<li><strong>Vector Database and Knowledge Library:</strong> Specialized databases store embeddings for fast and accurate retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Search Capabilities:</strong> Unlike traditional keyword searches, semantic search understands the meaning behind queries and retrieves contextually relevant information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-generation-phase">2. Generation Phase<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#2-generation-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Generation Phase" title="Direct link to 2. Generation Phase">​</a></h3>
<p>In the generation phase, the retrieved information is combined with the original user query and fed into the LLM. This process ensures that the LLM has access to both the context provided by the user’s query and the additional, relevant data fetched during the retrieval phase.</p>
<p>This integration allows the LLM to generate responses that are more accurate and contextually relevant, as it can draw from the most current and authoritative information available.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-steps-in-the-generation-phase">Key Steps in the Generation Phase:<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#key-steps-in-the-generation-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Steps in the Generation Phase:" title="Direct link to Key Steps in the Generation Phase:">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Augmented Prompt Construction:</strong> The relevant retrieved information is combined with the user’s original query to form an augmented prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Response Generation Using the Augmented Prompt:</strong> The LLM uses the augmented prompt to generate responses that are both accurate and contextually enriched.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-components-in-retrieval-augmented-generation">Technical Components in Retrieval Augmented Generation<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation#technical-components-in-retrieval-augmented-generation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical Components in Retrieval Augmented Generation" title="Direct link to Technical Components in Retrieval Augmented Generation">​</a></h3>
<p>While we understand how RAG works, let’s take a closer look at the key technical components involved in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding Models:</strong> OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002, Jina AI’s jina-embeddings-v2, and SentenceTransformers’ multi-QA models help convert text into numerical representations.</li>
<li><strong>Vector Stores:</strong> Tools like FAISS, Chroma DB, Pinecone, and Weaviate are used for storing and retrieving high-dimensional data representations.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> Crafting high-quality prompts enhances LLM performance by providing clear context and guiding the model to generate accurate and relevant responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging these components, RAG transforms LLMs into more powerful, context-aware AI systems capable of delivering highly relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Statistical distributions help us understand a problem better by assigning a range of possible values to the variables, making them very useful in data science and machine learning. Here are 7 types of distributions with intuitive examples that often occur in real-life data.</p>
<p>Whether you’re guessing if it’s going to rain tomorrow, betting on a sports team to win an away match, framing a policy for an insurance company, or simply trying your luck on blackjack at the casino, probability, and distributions come into action in all aspects of life to determine the likelihood of events.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning how these come to life in advanced applications, you might find our LLM Bootcamp to be a great resource to deepen your understanding.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="common-types-of-data">Common Types of Data<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#common-types-of-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Common Types of Data" title="Direct link to Common Types of Data">​</a></h2>
<p>Explaining various distributions becomes more manageable if we are familiar with the type of data they use. We encounter two different outcomes in day-to-day experiments: finite and infinite outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Discrete vs Continuous Data</strong><br>
<!-- -->When you roll a die or pick a card from a deck, you have a limited number of outcomes possible. This type of data is called Discrete Data, which can only take a specified number of values. For example, in rolling a die, the specified values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can see examples of infinite outcomes from discrete events in our daily environment. Recording time or measuring a person’s height has infinitely many values within a given interval. This type of data is called Continuous Data, which can have any value within a given range. That range can be finite or infinite.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you measure a watermelon’s weight. It can be any value from 10.2 kg, 10.24 kg, or 10.243 kg. Making it measurable but not countable; hence, it is continuous. On the other hand, suppose you count the number of boys in a class; since the value is countable, it is discrete.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="types-of-statistical-distributions">Types of Statistical Distributions<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#types-of-statistical-distributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Types of Statistical Distributions" title="Direct link to Types of Statistical Distributions">​</a></h2>
<p>Depending on the type of data we use, we have grouped distributions into two categories, discrete distributions for discrete data (finite outcomes) and continuous distributions for continuous data (infinite outcomes).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discrete-distributions">Discrete Distributions<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#discrete-distributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discrete Distributions" title="Direct link to Discrete Distributions">​</a></h3>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discrete-uniform-distribution-all-outcomes-are-equally-likely">Discrete Uniform Distribution: All Outcomes are Equally Likely<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#discrete-uniform-distribution-all-outcomes-are-equally-likely" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discrete Uniform Distribution: All Outcomes are Equally Likely" title="Direct link to Discrete Uniform Distribution: All Outcomes are Equally Likely">​</a></h4>
<p>In statistics, uniform distribution refers to a statistical distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. Consider rolling a six-sided die. You have an equal probability of obtaining all six numbers on your next roll, i.e., obtaining precisely one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, equaling a probability of 1/6, hence an example of a discrete uniform distribution.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bernoulli-distribution-single-trial-with-two-possible-outcomes">Bernoulli Distribution: Single-trial with Two Possible Outcomes<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#bernoulli-distribution-single-trial-with-two-possible-outcomes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bernoulli Distribution: Single-trial with Two Possible Outcomes" title="Direct link to Bernoulli Distribution: Single-trial with Two Possible Outcomes">​</a></h4>
<p>The Bernoulli distribution is one of the easiest distributions to understand. It can be used as a starting point to derive more complex distributions. Any event with a single trial and only two outcomes follows a Bernoulli distribution. Flipping a coin or choosing between True and False in a quiz are examples of a Bernoulli distribution.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="binomial-distribution-a-sequence-of-bernoulli-events">Binomial Distribution: A Sequence of Bernoulli Events<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#binomial-distribution-a-sequence-of-bernoulli-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Binomial Distribution: A Sequence of Bernoulli Events" title="Direct link to Binomial Distribution: A Sequence of Bernoulli Events">​</a></h4>
<p>The Binomial Distribution can be thought of as the sum of outcomes of an event following a Bernoulli distribution. Therefore, Binomial Distribution is used in binary outcome events, and the probability of success and failure is the same in all successive trials. An example of a binomial event would be flipping a coin multiple times to count the number of heads and tails.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="poisson-distribution-the-probability-that-an-event-may-or-may-not-occur">Poisson Distribution: The Probability that an Event May or May Not Occur<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#poisson-distribution-the-probability-that-an-event-may-or-may-not-occur" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Poisson Distribution: The Probability that an Event May or May Not Occur" title="Direct link to Poisson Distribution: The Probability that an Event May or May Not Occur">​</a></h4>
<p>Poisson distribution deals with the frequency with which an event occurs within a specific interval. Instead of the probability of an event, Poisson distribution requires knowing how often it happens in a particular period or distance. For example, a cricket chirps two times in 7 seconds on average. We can use the Poisson distribution to determine the likelihood of it chirping five times in 15 seconds.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-distributions">Continuous Distributions<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#continuous-distributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous Distributions" title="Direct link to Continuous Distributions">​</a></h3>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="normal-distribution-symmetric-distribution-of-values-around-the-mean">Normal Distribution: Symmetric Distribution of Values Around the Mean<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#normal-distribution-symmetric-distribution-of-values-around-the-mean" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Normal Distribution: Symmetric Distribution of Values Around the Mean" title="Direct link to Normal Distribution: Symmetric Distribution of Values Around the Mean">​</a></h4>
<p>Normal distribution is the most used distribution in data science. In a normal distribution graph, data is symmetrically distributed with no skew. When plotted, the data follows a bell shape, with most values clustering around a central region and tapering off as they go further away from the center.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="student-t-test-distribution-small-sample-size-approximation-of-a-normal-distribution">Student t-Test Distribution: Small Sample Size Approximation of a Normal Distribution<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#student-t-test-distribution-small-sample-size-approximation-of-a-normal-distribution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Student t-Test Distribution: Small Sample Size Approximation of a Normal Distribution" title="Direct link to Student t-Test Distribution: Small Sample Size Approximation of a Normal Distribution">​</a></h4>
<p>The student’s t-distribution, also known as the t distribution, is a type of statistical distribution similar to the normal distribution with its bell shape but has heavier tails. The t distribution is used instead of the normal distribution when you have small sample sizes.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exponential-distribution-model-elapsed-time-between-two-events">Exponential Distribution: Model Elapsed Time between Two Events<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/7-types-of-statistical-distributions#exponential-distribution-model-elapsed-time-between-two-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exponential Distribution: Model Elapsed Time between Two Events" title="Direct link to Exponential Distribution: Model Elapsed Time between Two Events">​</a></h4>
<p>Exponential distribution is one of the widely used continuous distributions. It is used to model the time taken between different events. For example, in physics, it is often used to measure radioactive decay; in engineering, to measure the time associated with receiving a defective part on an assembly line; and in finance, to measure the likelihood of the next default for a portfolio of financial assets.</p>

<p>Data is an essential component of the data exploration and model development process. The first thing that springs to mind when working with continuous variables is looking at the data distribution. We can adjust our machine-learning models to best match the problem if we can identify the pattern in the data distribution, which reduces the time to get to an accurate outcome.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we approach the close of 2024 and step into 2025, I want to caution developer communities about the profound transformation taking place in the software development landscape. The rise of agent-driven technologies and generative AI tools is accelerating automation at an unprecedented rate, redefining what it means to be a developer. While this brings opportunities for enhanced productivity, it also demands a shift in skillsets — moving away from routine coding tasks toward mastering AI collaboration, ethical AI governance, and high-level system design.</p>
<p>Developers who fail to adapt risk being left behind in a world where natural language interfaces, autonomous debugging, and self-healing systems are becoming the new norm. The era of creative, strategy-driven software engineering is upon us, and embracing these changes is no longer optional — it’s essential for staying relevant.</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly influenced countless industries, with software development being one of the most dynamic arenas of change. As we move toward an AI-driven future, intelligent agents — autonomous systems that perceive, reason, and act — are emerging as game-changers in software design, development, and deployment.</p>
<p>I want to briefly discuss the rise of AI agents, their potential to reshape the development process, and how this paradigm shift will influence the future of software engineering.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-ai-agents">What Are AI Agents?<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/the-future-of-ai-agent-driven-paradigms#what-are-ai-agents" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Are AI Agents?" title="Direct link to What Are AI Agents?">​</a></h3>
<p>AI agents are programs that autonomously perform tasks by leveraging capabilities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception</strong>: Interpreting data from the environment (e.g., sensor inputs, user commands).</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning</strong>: Making decisions based on goals, constraints, and contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Acting</strong>: Executing tasks with minimal or no human intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: Continuously improving performance by analyzing past outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="agents-as-co-developers">Agents as Co-Developers<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/the-future-of-ai-agent-driven-paradigms#agents-as-co-developers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Agents as Co-Developers" title="Direct link to Agents as Co-Developers">​</a></h3>
<p>The most notable evolution of agents in software development is their role as co-developers or even autonomous developers. AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc already demonstrate this concept, but future agents are expected to take it further by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing architectures.</li>
<li>Debugging complex systems autonomously.</li>
<li>Refactoring legacy code without human input.</li>
<li>Collaborating with teams as virtual peers, capable of participating in standups and sprint planning.</li>
</ul>

The Rise of Agent-Orchestrated Pipelines" title="Direct link to 1. The Rise of Agent-Orchestrated Pipelines">​</a></h4>
<p>In modern DevOps, automation is key. AI agents will further streamline Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamically adapting configurations for optimal performance.</li>
<li>Automating rollbacks and recovery with predictive analysis.</li>
<li>Orchestrating microservices in real-time to adapt to changing workloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will reduce the reliance on manual monitoring and intervention, empowering developers to focus on innovation.</p>

Natural Language-Centric Development" title="Direct link to 2. Natural Language-Centric Development">​</a></h4>
<p>The future of coding may no longer require extensive syntax knowledge. With natural language interfaces, developers will communicate with agents to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate entire applications from high-level descriptions.</li>
<li>Add features by specifying functionality in plain language.</li>
<li>Perform advanced queries like “Optimise my database schema for this traffic pattern.”</li>
</ul>

Code-Generation Agents" title="Direct link to 3. Code-Generation Agents">​</a></h4>
<p>Generative AI has already shown its potential in creating boilerplate code. The next leap is enabling agents to write domain-specific applications tailored to specific business requirements, even in industries with stringent compliance standards like finance, healthcare, or aviation.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-self-healing-systems">4.

Self-Healing Systems" title="Direct link to 4. Self-Healing Systems">​</a></h4>
<p>AI agents will monitor systems in production, identifying issues, generating patches, and deploying fixes autonomously. This approach significantly minimises downtime and enhances reliability, reducing operational costs.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-democratisation-of-development">5.

<p>Agent-driven paradigms will enable non-developers to build applications, lowering the barrier to entry. No-code/low-code platforms will evolve into agent-powered environments, where users can define complex workflows or applications without ever writing a line of code.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="impact-on-the-role-of-software-developers">Impact on the Role of Software Developers<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/the-future-of-ai-agent-driven-paradigms#impact-on-the-role-of-software-developers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact on the Role of Software Developers" title="Direct link to Impact on the Role of Software Developers">​</a></h3>
<p>While AI agents will take over repetitive and resource-intensive tasks, developers will transition into roles that emphasise creativity, strategy, and oversight. Here’s how the role will shift:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focus on High-Level Design</strong>: Developers will become system architects, focusing on designing modular and scalable solutions while agents handle implementation details.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Ethics and Governance</strong>: With AI taking centre stage, developers must ensure that agents adhere to ethical guidelines, fairness, and security standards.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration with AI Agents</strong>: Rather than replacing developers, agents will work alongside them. The ability to effectively manage and communicate with agents will become a critical skill.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Productivity</strong>: By automating mundane tasks, agents will free developers to focus on creative problem-solving and long-term innovation.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenges-and-risks">Challenges and Risks<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/the-future-of-ai-agent-driven-paradigms#challenges-and-risks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges and Risks" title="Direct link to Challenges and Risks">​</a></h3>
<p>While the potential benefits of agent-driven development are immense, there are significant challenges to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trust and Transparency</strong>: How do we ensure that AI agents make ethical and reliable decisions? This includes understanding how they generate code or refactor systems.</li>
<li><strong>Skills Gap</strong>: Developers will need new skill sets to work effectively with AI agents, such as prompt engineering, machine learning fundamentals, and human-AI collaboration techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong>: Agents, if not properly managed, could introduce vulnerabilities into systems. Rigorous validation and monitoring processes will be essential.</li>

<p>DeepSeek’s first-generation of reasoning models with comparable performance to OpenAI-o1, including six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen.</p>
<p>On January 20, 2025, the DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero were released. They were based on V3-Base. Like V3, each is a mixture of experts with 671B total parameters and 37B activated parameters. They also released some “DeepSeek-R1-Distill” models, which are not based on R1. Instead, they are similar to other open-weight models like LLaMA and Qwen, fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by R1. The model I have installed and tested is DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 7Billion parameters.</p>

<p>I’ll walk through the process of setting up a local environment on a MacBook Pro M3 (18GB) for testing the DeepSeek model using Ollama, n8n, and Docker via OrbStack. If you’re looking to get hands-on with an LLM like DeepSeek, follow these steps carefully to get your system set up. This setup is suitable ONLY for performing PoCs and development environment.</p>
<p>Before we begin, make sure you have the following:</p>
<ol>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“It Just Works” is propaganda: it hides the trail that products cut through our societies and the natural world to get to us.
<em>Oliver Meredith Cox</em><br>
<em>UX Collective</em><br>
<em>Published: 1 day ago</em><br>
<em>Read Time: 13 min</em></p>
<p>When it comes to technology, we are depoliticized: too often we talk about technology as something for which “making decisions in groups” (politics) is irrelevant. We think that technology is a little out of reach, that its structure doesn’t concern us or is better arranged by someone else. Or, worst, we don’t know that the technology in question even exists.</p>
<p>The phrase “It Just Works” is a propagandistic lullaby, from the diet-coke-button attitude that technology “just” appears at our doors and stores. From where? Who knows?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example-image">Example Image<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/ai-agents#example-image" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example Image" title="Direct link to Example Image">​</a></h2>
<p>In a wonderful article in the Russia Post, the authors discuss how the Putin regime depoliticizes topics in order to reduce scrutiny. The idea is to make certain topics no longer political issues, thereby sucking air away from the people who would otherwise pressure for change or even become centers of power outside your autocracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...depoliticization. Its grip on society got tighter and tighter. People with democratic and liberal views who continued to be interested in and engage in politics were painted as ‘demschiza’, short for ‘democratic schizophrenics’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People free of democratic schizophrenia thus say, “We are simple people, we don’t get involved in big politics.” The affable Vlad Vexler smartly summarizes the Putin project and depoliticization in the video below:</p>
<p>(Embed video or link)</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-depoliticization-parallel">The Depoliticization Parallel<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/ai-agents#the-depoliticization-parallel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Depoliticization Parallel" title="Direct link to The Depoliticization Parallel">​</a></h2>
<p>I’d like to draw a parallel to a similar trend, found in technology: there are areas of technology in which we tolerate normally morally objectionable issues (monopoly, restrictions on freedom, environmental damage, etc.), either regarding them with apathy, not regarding the issues as issues, or not being aware that the thing exists at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don’t know that much about technology, it just works."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="politics-and-depoliticization">Politics and Depoliticization<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/ai-agents#politics-and-depoliticization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Politics and Depoliticization" title="Direct link to Politics and Depoliticization">​</a></h2>
<p>Politics is, according to Wikipedia, “the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups.”</p>
<p>There are of course other colloquial senses of this word: one is roughly equivalent to “party political” or “partisan”—pertaining to political parties and their activities, the latter “strongly” so. For instance, when Gavin Newsom warned Trump not to make his visit to LA during the fires “political,” he meant, “Don’t use this tragedy to try to hurt my side and boost your side.”</p>
<p>The other sense is equivalent to “Machiavellian” (describing a means of operation based on whatever works rather than virtue): in politics, this means alliances, favors, leaks.</p>
<p>When our friends at Russia Post talk about depoliticization, they don’t mean that Putin is making his country less Machiavellian: they mean that he is preventing people from effectively discussing issues and forging change. While party politics is tiresome, it is partly a natural outgrowth of democracy; it too is compromised in Russia.</p>]]></content>

<p>The pace of AI advancements is unprecedented, with significant improvements in both model capabilities and cost efficiency. However, the economic implications of AI remain inadequately understood, with unsatisfactory insights from AI practitioners, economists, and think tanks. Economists often underestimate AI’s potential impact due to limited engagement with cutting-edge developments.</p>
<p>Key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> AI displaces labor in tasks where it is highly substitutable.</li>
<li><strong>Complementarity:</strong> AI can augment labor in tasks where human expertise is still essential.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity Effect:</strong> Lower costs from AI can increase demand for non-automated tasks, potentially raising employment overall.</li>
<li><strong>Reinstatement Effect:</strong> New tasks may emerge as AI automates existing ones, creating roles that require uniquely human skills.</li>

<p>Generative AI has rapidly swept across society, with revolutionary tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney amassing millions of users at an unprecedented rate. Numerous software applications, ranging from the sleep tracker app Sleep Cycle (that I personally use), to office productivity tools such as Slack and Teams, are racing to integrate AI capabilities.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool in the AI landscape, offering a new way to process and understand data that is structured as graphs. From social networks to protein folding, graphs represent complex relationships and structures that traditional models struggle to capture. But what makes GNNs so unique, and how have they transformed various industries?</p>
<p>Unlike conventional neural networks that operate on grid-like data (such as images or text), GNNs are designed to work directly on graph data, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them. This allows GNNs to capture complex dependencies and interactions in data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks like node classification, link prediction, and graph-based recommendation systems.</p>
<p>The success of GNNs in areas such as social media, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs has made them one of the most exciting developments in AI. By leveraging the power of graph structures, GNNs are helping machines better understand the world around them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-graph-neural-networks-work">How Do Graph Neural Networks Work?<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/the-evolution-of-graph-neural-networks-and-their-impact-on-ai#how-do-graph-neural-networks-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Do Graph Neural Networks Work?" title="Direct link to How Do Graph Neural Networks Work?">​</a></h2>
<p>At the core of a GNN is the idea of <strong>message passing</strong>, where information is propagated between nodes in a graph. Each node aggregates information from its neighbors and updates its representation accordingly. This allows the model to learn how nodes are interconnected and to make predictions based on their relationships to other nodes in the graph.</p>
<p>The architecture of a GNN typically consists of several layers of message-passing operations, followed by readout layers that aggregate the learned representations of nodes to make final predictions. The model is trained to minimize a loss function that measures how well the predicted graph-based task aligns with the true data.</p>
<p>GNNs are highly flexible and can be applied to a wide range of graph-based problems. For example, in <strong>social networks</strong>, GNNs can be used to recommend friends or predict user behavior by analyzing the relationships between individuals. In <strong>biological networks</strong>, they can help predict the function of proteins by modeling the interactions between molecules.</p>
